This is Ye! Welcome to my page.
I am an Assistant Professor at University College London. I previously worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Carnegie Mellon University and received my PhD from KTH Royal Institute of Technology. My research focuses on developing the next generation of code agents to automate software engineering tasks, with an emphasis on codebase context retrieval to improve LLM capabilities, automated issue resolution, and the construction of code agent memory. Beyond academia, I am the co-founder of [EuniAI](https://euni.ai/), a startup dedicated to transforming research into real-world solutions that help developers overcome practical software challenges.

We are organizing the [LMPL@SPLASH 2025 workshop](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025/lmpl-2025) and the [APR@ICSE 2025 workshop](https://program-repair.org/workshop-2025/), we look forward to your submissions!
