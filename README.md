This is Ye! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Software and Societal Systems Department (S3D) of Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. [Claire Le Goues](https://clairelegoues.com). We are exploring research topics including but not limited to **AI-Assisted program repair and test generation**, **smart contract vulnerabilities** [(FSE'23)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3611643.3616343), and **debugging in WebAssembly**.

Prior to that, I completed my B.S. degree at Sichuan University and my Ph.D. degree at KTH Royal Institute of Technology where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Martin Monperrus](https://www.kth.se/profile/monp), Prof. [Benoit Baudry](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/department-directory/professors/professor/in/in36891/sg/Benoit%20Baudry/), and co-supervised by Prof. [Matias Martinez](https://www.martinezmatias.com/). During my PhD, my research focuses on **automated program repair** [(ICSE'22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3510003.3510222),[ASE'22)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3551349.3556926) , **fault localization** [(ICSE'24)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12015.pdf), **patch correctness assessment** [(TSE'22](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9399306),[EMSE'21)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-020-09920-w), and **automated test generation** [(EMSE'21](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-020-09920-w),[JSS'21)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0164121220302193). 

I was fortunate to visit The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) from October 2021 to April 2022. It was a fruitful experience to be advised by Prof. [Daniel Xiapu Luo](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxluo/).

Outside of work, I enjoy sports (cycling/hiking/badminton), carpentry, playing pool, and playing the harmonica.
